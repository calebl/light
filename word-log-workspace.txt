  How it began…*\n\nAll   created     world was good. There was food   drink   living beings. It was     favorable context   Adam   Eve,   first       first woman, first lived. warned them   long they lived   him,   obedience, they would live forever, they disobeyed, they would surely die. commanded  : “You may surely eat   every tree     garden,     tree     knowledge   good   evil you shall eat,       day   you eat   it you shall surely die.” (Genesis 2:16-17).   warning   was very clear: disobedience produces death.\n\nLet’s see how   devil, Satan (شيطان –   “  seducer”), tempted Adam through his wife Eve.  appeared her     form   serpent, made her an attractive proposition:\n\nHe said   woman, “Did actually say, ‘You shall eat   tree     garden’?”     woman said   serpent, “We may eat     fruit     trees     garden, said, ‘You shall eat     fruit     tree       midst     garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’”   serpent said   woman, “You will surely die.   knows   you eat   it eyes will opened,   you will like  knowing good   evil.” So   woman saw     tree was good   food,     it was delight   eyes,       tree was desired make one wise, she     fruit   ate,   she gave some her husband who was her,   ate (Genesis 3: 1-6).\n\nThough   temptation came from outside, it was from within themselves   they listened it,   they willingly agreed believe     lie   Satan. Eve, like Adam, did heed   warnings    ; They believed   wanted deprive them   something,   ambition was born   their heart become like  His equal.     first time,   (  human being)   experienced  ,   disobedience \n\n  does go   on his  immediately applied foretold: “  day   you eat   it you shall surely die.” (Genesis 2:17). Yet Adam   Eve did die physically at once; they first experienced spiritual death,   loss   their       invasion     their lives. They began fear  want hide,   they both sought save appearances before  did see everything. Adam tried blame his wife   his fault.\n\n  could keep   his paradise his creatures, so associated   revolt   Satan,   drove them out.

Later, they themselves went through physical death, experiencing it like “return   dust”.   striking narrative   these events found        Torah, Genesis 3. Later,   Injil will summarize   divine principle applied by      : “       , death.” (Romans 6:23).\n\n*  Adam   forgiven?*\n\nI know   Muslims believe   Adam   Eve        they later repented   forgiven. Everything would have become normal before,    ’s plan   Adam   Eve would have resumed   course.\n\nYet   Muslims unanimous   saying  result   their  , Adam   Eve driven from   garden. they have  ,   after their repentance everything will have become before, why have they   reintroduced     garden? Yet, neither they nor   their descendants ever able return   garden.\n\nI would like ask you   following question: “Why do you   I suffer   consequences       Adam   born   paradise   why do pass through death?”  I invite you continue reading get   Scripture answer these  .\n\n    “      death”.
