   "title": "Can I know God?",
   "content": "No person, by his own efforts, has never been able to know God. Nor will anyone ever succeed in knowing God, unless God comes to his aid to reveal Himself to him. The question, then, is whether God really wants to make Himself known? Does he want men and women to know him in truth? Having created mankind, is it not self-evident that he wants humans to know him?\n\nThe question to ask is, \“Does God really want to visit us?\” I now have good news for you. God so desired that we may know Him and love Him with all our heart, that in His infinite mercy He came to dwell among men.\n\nSome two thousand years ago, in a special way, God made his light shine in our world. The Light of God, also called the Word of God, came to dwell among us in a human body by the Virgin Mary, from whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ. John (one of Jesus’ disciples) wrote: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God … And the Word was made flesh, and it dwelt among us …” (John 1: 1, 14). The apostle Paul says in his turn: “And unquestionably the mystery of piety is great: he who was made manifest in the flesh, justified by the Spirit, saw angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed in the world, elevated in glory “(1Timothy 3:16). Jesus was truly a man, born of Mary. He had everything of man, except sin. At the same time, he was above man, for he was one with God. Therefore the coming of Jesus Christ into the world was also the coming of God among men. This is clearly stated in his title “Emmanuel”, which means “God among us”."},

 {"faq_id": "2", "title": "Do Christians worship three gods?", "content": "__Let’s be clear!__\n\nMary is neither God nor a part of God. The Holy Word of God does not teach this. The Bible teaches rather that although Mary is a pious woman, she was not perfect.  She was like all the rest of us (Luke 1:47).\n\n__God is one.__\n\nIt must also be clear that Christians do not worship three gods! The key verse of the Torah of the Prophet Moses proclaims, “Hear, O Israel! The LORD our God is the only LORD. (Deuteronomy 6:4)\n\n__The One and Only God exists in three distinct persons__\n\nYet the Bible unambiguously teaches that there is more than one who is God. Let us take care that we say: there is not more than one God, but a plurality of people at the core of the divine essence: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n\n__1 + 1 + 1 = 1?__\n\n[Read More here.](http://answering-islam.org/Trinity/index.html)"},
